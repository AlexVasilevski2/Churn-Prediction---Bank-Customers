<h1>Project 1. Customer Churn - Bank Business</h1>
The purpose of this project is identify customers that are likely to leave the bank, the business can then think of strategies on how to retain these customer. 

One way can be to segment these customer (an exercise for another time), and offer to them personalised marketing service, discounts etc. 

The key 4 main variables that predicted churn. 

-	Age, more than 50% of the customers aged between 51-60 were predicted to churn or leave the bank.

-	Estimated Salary, higher salary indicated higher portion of customers churning ( I would think the higher the salary the less likely a customer would shop around and there for leave a bank, unless the bank does provide great product for high income customer, perhaps they demand more )
  
-	Credit Score, low credit score has a higher customer churn, perhaps these customers are shopping around for credit / credit cards.
  
-	Bank Balance, higher balance indicates higher customer churn, could be a similar reason for estimated salary.
  
Tools Used:
I have used Python in Jupiter notebooks, pandas library to import and transform that dataset for analysis. Random Forest library or algorithm to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving.
Power BI to visualize the predicted output.
